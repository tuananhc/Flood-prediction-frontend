The client has provisioned a smart digital solution to alleviate challenges of Flood Management – as traditional methods can be expensive/slow and cannot keep up with the developing climate and urban landscape.​

To solve this problem, our prototypes focused on creating a digital twin of Hong Kong using Hong Kong Observatory's "diverse set of data" [1]​

Our solutions are aimed to assist in "planning and managing flood risks" for Civilian, NGO and Government users specifically.​

Machine Learning models will be trained on this data to forewarn users  in "diverse flood risk situations" users to assist in flood management, mitigation and planning. ​

​PROJECT SCOPE 

Focus only on 10 key districts in Hong Kong as the 'digital twin'​

Utilize key data to develop a minimum viable product​

Allow users to filter regions of interest​

Allow admins to upload their own datasets​

Project utilizes historical and predicted data, not live data​

Mass scalability and deployment is not in scope​

PROJECT OBJECTIVES

Deliver a Machine Learning Model, able to accurately predict flood severity and location​

Arm government users with tools to self-manage the site​

Inform civilian users of potential flood hazards ​

PROJECT DELIVERABLES

In addition to our research articles and design concepts we have delivered our final design - Flood Tech, which collates the best features into one.​

We have delivered a digital twin map that allows users to see predictions based on the weather stations in that area and important metrics.​

During development, we ran into issues with a few key areas:​

Complex missing data issues, live data scrapped​

Some functionality has been limited to focus on the M.V.P​

RUNNING THE PROJECT
Run the commands in the README.md file to install dependencies and run the code.
